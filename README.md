# Summary
Remind Me is a web application where users can create, manage, and explore their reminders! Each user can sign up for an account, log in, create reminders, and edit their reminders. I was inspired to build this app for my Wife who constantly forgets things and refuses to use the Reminder app due to it's "simplicity".

# Stretch Goals
I would love to add animations to each category to make it more interactive along with styling the page a bit better to move the NavBar to the top of the page while keeping the text inside the background photo.
